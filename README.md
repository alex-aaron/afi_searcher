# AfiSearcher

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/afi_searcher`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'afi_searcher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install afi_searcher

## Usage

1) To initialize program, run `ruby bin/afi_searcher.rb` in your terminal. 
2) The program will prompt you with a list of DISPLAY OPTIONS and SORT OPTIONS allowing you to:
   - Display the list of films from 1-100
   - Display the details of an individual movie
   - Show a list of artists for every creative field featured (director, writer, cast, etc.)
   - Sort by director, cast member, writer, producer, editor, cinematographer, and production company
   - See the most credited artist by category
3) When typing, follow instructions EXACTLY. For example, if you are instructed to `enter 'directors`, type exactly as displayed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
